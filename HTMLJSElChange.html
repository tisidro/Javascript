<!-- This JS is in the head of the doc. 
But generally Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves 
the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display of 
other items on the page.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Clicking worked! Text has changed.";
}
</script>
</head>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript inserted in Head Tags</h2>

<p id="demo">Some Random Paragraph.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click to change text</button>

</body>
</html> 

<!-- putting JS in HTML file does not provide
separation of concerns though.
So don't do it! :) 
instead refer to external JS file using
something like 
<script src="myScript2.js"></script> -->
